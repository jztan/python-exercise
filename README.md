Python Learning Journey 🐍

Welcome to this repository! This is a special project to teach my 10-year-old son Python programming in a fun and engaging way. We’ll start with the basics and gradually work our way up to creating cool projects using Python.

🎯 Goals

	•	Learn the basics of Python 3: Understanding variables, loops, conditions, and functions.
	•	Explore Python with Turtle: Create drawings and simple animations using the Turtle graphics library.
	•	Develop small projects: Apply what we learn to build mini-games and interactive programs.

📚 Lessons

Below is a breakdown of the lessons and projects we’ll be working on:

	1.	Simple Calculator Program
	•	Installing Python and setting up the environment
	•	Basic syntax: print statements, variables, and data types
	•	Simple calculations
	2.	Guess the Number Game
	•	If-else conditions
	•	While and for loops
	•	Basic user input
	3.	Simple Text-Based Adventure Game
	•	Creating functions
	•	Using built-in modules
	•	Introduction to Turtle

🛠 Tools and Resources

	•	Python 3: The main programming language we’ll be using.
	•	Visual Studio Code or IDLE: A code editor or IDE for writing and testing Python code.

💡 Tips for Learning

	•	Experiment: Don’t be afraid to change the code and see what happens.
	•	Ask Questions: Always ask if something is unclear. Programming is all about problem-solving.
	•	Take Breaks: If a concept is hard, take a break and come back to it later.
